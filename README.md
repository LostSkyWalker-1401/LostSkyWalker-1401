## 🚀 What I'm Building

### 🧠 **StillFrame AI** — *AI-Powered Reflective Companion*
> An experimental AI system that listens, asks better questions, and detects patterns over time.

**Not a therapist replacement.** A tool for accessibility, reflection, and self-improvement.

```
Status: [████████░░] 80% — Early build → User testing
Focus: Structured thinking, emotional pattern recognition, meaningful conversations
```

**Philosophy:**
- Humans stay in the loop
- AI handles data, not diagnosis
- Privacy-first, reflection-focused

## 💭 How I Think

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 On AI</b></summary>

```
AI doesn't replace people. It replaces inefficiency.

Small teams will do what required large orgs before.
That's the shift that matters.

I'm optimistic because AI solves real problems,
not just creates narratives.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💼 On Business</b></summary>

```
I don't memorize frameworks.
I look at what shipped last quarter and why it worked.

If an idea doesn't survive contact with reality, I discard it.

Execution beats planning every time.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📚 On Learning</b></summary>

```
My opinions are version-controlled.
When I'm wrong, I update.

Learning in public means:
- Documenting failures honestly
- Sharing the messy middle
- Updating beliefs based on evidence

Progress > Perfection
```
</details>

---

## 🎨 How I Work

```yaml
philosophy:
  - build_first: "Demo before claiming expertise"
  - learn_public: "Document failures as honestly as wins"
  - iterate_fast: "Progress > Polish (early on)"
  - stay_honest: "If it doesn't work, say so"

workflow:
  morning: "Review yesterday's experiments"
  work: "Ship something, even if small"
  evening: "Document what broke and why"
  
mindset: "Early. Breaking things. Learning publicly."
```

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On

I'm looking for:

- 🏢 **Founders/teams** building serious products
- 🤖 **AI companies** experimenting beyond surface-level hype  
- 🧠 **Clear thinkers** who value execution over ideas
- 🛠️ **Open source projects** that need infrastructure work

**Not interested in:**
- ❌ Tool list discussions
- ❌ Motivational quote exchanges
- ❌ Pure ideation without execution

**What I bring:**
- ✅ Test ideas instead of selling them
- ✅ Build working prototypes quickly
- ✅ Document honestly (failures included)
- ✅ CI/CD & DevOps infrastructure skills
