# 💫 About Me

# Hey, I'm Goutam.

I'm a builder. I look for gaps and try to close them by shipping things — even when they’re rough, incomplete, or uncomfortable.

I dropped out of college, learned quickly that execution matters more than credentials, and now I spend most of my time experimenting with AI systems, automation, and developer tools — figuring out what actually works in the real world.

I'm 22, based in India, and early in my journey.  
That’s intentional. I share the process, not just the outcomes.

## 🚀 What I'm Building Right Now

### **StillFrame AI** *(concept → early build)*

An AI-powered reflective companion.

I loosely call it an “AI psychologist,” but in practice it’s a system that:
- Listens instead of rushing to answers  
- Asks better follow-up questions  
- Detects behavioral and emotional patterns over time  

It’s **not meant to replace therapists** — the human element stays.  
The goal is accessibility, reflection, and better tooling around self-improvement.

Early-stage, experimental, and evolving.

## 🧪 Projects & Experiments

### **clarity-ai**
A TypeScript-based project exploring structured AI interactions and clarity-focused outputs.

- Focus: clean inputs, reduced hallucination, structured reasoning
- Status: active experimentation
- Tech: TypeScript, modern frontend tooling

---

### **telegram-channel-downloader** *(fork & customization)*
A Node.js-based utility for downloading and organizing Telegram channel content.

- Worked on understanding workflow, automation, and edge cases
- Used as a learning base for async flows and scraping logic
- Tech: Node.js

---

### **Workflow Manager** *(fork)*
A workflow-oriented project used to understand:
- GitHub Actions
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automation-first development

Primary value: learning how production workflows are actually managed.

## 🧠 How I Think

**On AI**  
AI won’t replace people — it replaces inefficiency.  
Small teams will do what required large orgs earlier. That’s the shift that matters.

I’m optimistic about AI because it’s solving real problems, not just creating narratives.

**On Business**  
I don’t memorize frameworks.  
I look at what shipped last quarter and why it worked.

If an idea doesn’t survive contact with reality, I discard it.

**On Learning**  
My opinions are version-controlled.  
When I’m wrong, I update.

## 🔧 How I Work

- I build first, explain second  
- If I can’t demo it, I don’t claim expertise  
- I document failures as honestly as wins  
- Progress > polish (early on)

---

## 🤝 What I'm Looking For

- Founders or teams building serious products
- Companies experimenting with AI beyond surface-level hype
- People who value **clear thinking + execution**

If you’re here for tool lists or motivational quotes — wrong profile.  
If you’re building and want someone who tests ideas instead of selling them — let’s talk.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Shipping early versions of StillFrame
- Studying real-world AI systems and workflows
- Becoming reliable at execution, not just ideation

---

## 🔥 Bottom Line

I’m early.
I’ll break things.
I’ll learn in public.

Credibility comes from building — and I’m building.
